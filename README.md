# realtime_socket_io

A new Flutter package project.

## Getting Started

This package uses [Provider]{https://pub.dev/packages/provider} and [socket_io_client]{https://pub.dev/packages/socket_io_client}.

By using `realtime_socket_io` you will be able to connect to your WebSocket Service, add a socket to a desire Room and listen to an update broadcast from your server. 

The `example` shows about the implementation and how to use this package on Flutter and it also contains a `ServerExample` written in Node JS that uses `express` and `socket.io`.
